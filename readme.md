# This program is made out of spite, I do not like installers with non numerical progress bars, so I made this as I was installing baldurs gate 3 from gog exclusively to know the current progress as a percentage, it uses cv2 as the image recognition library and just takes an image path, its incredibly rudementary stuff.
You need to manually edit it to the desired image path.
I legit dont even know if it truly works, I think it does, it kinda did when I tried it, figure it out, do a pull request, or a fork or whatever, this is literally just for my own amusement.
